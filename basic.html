    <body>
<h1>I really like cars</h1>
<p>Recently I have <strong>REALLY</strong> liked cars and gotten into them heavily. <br>I have started working on them with my dad recently and I have been having fun with tinkering with my car ever since.</p>
<h2>Why I like working on them</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It is fun figuring out how to take off and put on different parts</li>
    <li>I get to go deeper into my own car and can work on and know more about my own car</li>
    <li>I like working with my hands and my car is a great way for me to work with both my mind and hands</li>
</ul>
<h2>How I changed my headlights</h2>
<ol>
    <li>I had to <em>remove</em> my front bumper</li>
    <li>Un-wire the wires from earlier headlights and remove the lights themselves</li>
    <li>Hook the new wires in <strong><em>then</em></strong> place bumper back on</li>
    <li><strong><em>Finally</em></strong> fit back on the new headlights</li>
</ol>
<h2>My conclusion</h2>
<p> In conclusion I <strong>really</strong> love working on cars and I am grateful to my dad for introducing me into cars.</p>
